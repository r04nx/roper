# pipenv
#  According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#  However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#  having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#  install all needed dependencies.
# Pipfile.lock

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow
